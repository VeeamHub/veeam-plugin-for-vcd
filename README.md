# Veeam Plugin for VMware vCloud Director

The Veeam plugin for vCloud Director allows the [Veeam vCD Self-Service Backup Portal](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/em/em_managing_vms_in_vcd_org.html?ver=95u4) to be accessible natively within the vCD Web UI. It leverages the [vCD Extension SDK](https://github.com/vmware/vcd-ext-sdk) to make this possible.
